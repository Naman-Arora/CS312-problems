# Coding Problems for CS 312: Introduction to Programming

* These are the solutions to a series of Java programming problems to test my pervious introductory knowledge of Java programming, as I am not sure if I want to skip CS 312: Introduction to Programming at UT Austin and continue to CS 314: Data Structures.
* Problems are sourced from the [CS 312 Fall 2020 Schedule](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs312/schedule.htm).
* The problems are on the [Practice-It](https://practiceit.cs.washington.edu/) website, accessible to anyone.
* Completed problems are put in the **completed** folder in the repository. In the **completed** folder, the problem solutions are further nested by the date the were supposed to be completed according to the schedule.
